Continue your Product Hunt / Reddit clone by adding the server-side components. Your project should have a user login, and allow users to create new posts.

Your project must include a server (Node/Express), a connected database (PostgreSQL), a connected client (React), and form with submit and data validation (Redux-Form), and user authentication.

## Requirements

- [ ] Be pushed to Github 
- [ ] Use [descriptive Git commits](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- [ ] Use small, single purpose Git commits
- [ ] Contain `README.md` with project summary and setup
- [ ] Contain a valid [`package.json`](http://browsenpm.org/package.json) file with all appropriate fields completed
- [ ] Contain `.gitignore` file (ignoring `node_modules` and system files)
- [ ] Contain this self-evaluated spec checklist renamed `specs.md`
- [X] Use ESLint with the [AirBnB style-guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [X] Run without errors with `npm start`

### Functional

Your project must:

- [ ] Contain a login form allowing users to authenticate with email and password
